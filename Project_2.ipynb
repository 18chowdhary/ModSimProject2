    "\n",
    "The bode plots for second order high pass filters don't exactly match the theoretical model for a second-order high pass filter (while first-order high pass filters do match the theoretical model). This is due to a exchange of current between the two high-pass filters. Thus, we decided to create a model that would determine the optimal combination of resistors and capacitors for a given tau to minimize current flow between the two high pass filters in order to minimize the error between the theoretical bode plot and the simulated bode plot."

    "The model ends up basically eliminating the second filter entirely, so in future iterations, we would put more constraints on the Rs and Cs it could choose to prevent it from choosing Rs and Cs for the second filter that are effectively close to 0.
